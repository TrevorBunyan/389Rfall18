### Part 2 (75 pts)

If I had discovered these security issues, the first person I would contact is my boss. Informing my superior enables the company to respond to the problem quickly, preventing any malicious use of these security problems. Doing this first ensures that the problem is solved before anyone outside the company is aware of it. While this is good for reducing the risk of attack, the public still has a right to know about the potential risks that were found. Once the problem was solved I would strongly recommend to my boss that we get in front of the problem and take ownership for the mistakes.

In the event that my boss or company does not want to solve the problem and leave the security issues as is, I would inform a watchdog group. While this goes against the company I work for, I believe that we have an obligation to protect and inform those who use our product. If no action is taken after that, I would inform the media of the potential risks, but not the exact method to enact an attack. This would force the company to address the issues and give them time to work on the problems.

If I was to do nothing I would be responsible for any damages, injuries, or lives lost due to the security problems. I had the opportunity to prevent any harm from arising and did not act upon it. Whether my creations improve the world or hurt it, I am responsible for the impact they have.
